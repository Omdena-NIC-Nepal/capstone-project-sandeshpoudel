another 
ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5)

from data set url https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data

I choose era5-x0.25
ERA5 is the most accurate and modern global reanalysis dataset provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).

“x0.25” means it has high spatial resolution (0.25° ≈ ~25 km grid).

Covers hourly or daily variables from 1950 to present.
